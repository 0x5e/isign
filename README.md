# iresign
iOS app signer / re-signer. Does not require OS X.


## Testing

To run tests, use [py.test](http://pytest.org). The deeper tests of functionality
require [codesign](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/codesign.1.html)
to run, so they only run on a Macintosh computer with developer tools.
