The test apps in this directory were created with 

https://github.com/saucelabs/isignTestApp

While these test apps are Swift 2, we have also tested isign
with Swift 1.x. We just were unsure about distributing those 
apps with isign, since the Swift framework was not licensed 
under an OSI-approved license before version 2.x.

isign also works with plain Objective-C apps, but the Swift
app gives it a more thorough test since it involves signing
dynamic libraries.
